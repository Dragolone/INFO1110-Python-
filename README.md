# INFO1110 Assignment Overview

This assignment is part of the INFO1110 course, and it focuses on implementing and emulating a simple version of a photonic circuit. The assignment involves using C++ to create an emulation that controls and manages the behavior of photons, which are emitted by lasers and interact with other photonic components. The key goal is to build an emulation that can accurately simulate a photonic circuit, providing a hands-on experience in building and working with circuit-like components through coding.

### Key Features of the Assignment

The assignment is broken down into several features that need to be implemented step-by-step. Each feature is designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth development process. The main components include:

1. **SET-MY-CIRCUIT**: Setting up the circuit board and placing components like emitters (lasers) and receivers (photodetectors).
2. **GET-MY-INPUTS**: Allowing the user to specify inputs to customize the setup of the photonic circuit.
3. **RUN-MY-CIRCUIT**: Running the circuit simulation by processing a sequence of emitted photons, monitoring their movement, and absorbing them using receivers.
4. **ADD-MY-MIRRORS**: Adding mirrors to the circuit to control the path of the photons, changing their direction to reach their intended targets.

Each feature involves implementing functions and classes that can work together to simulate the behavior of a photonic circuit. Users can add different elements to customize the circuit's setup, which provides flexibility in creating various circuit layouts.

### Grading and Evaluation

The assignment was divided into different parts, with each feature being automatically tested. Additionally, there was a manually graded testing component to evaluate the code style and correctness.

My performance in this assignment was quite successful, and I received a final score of **29.10 out of 30**.
